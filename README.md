# CSS 342 / 343 Docker Demo

## Purpose
This repository is intended to support you configuring your Docker container to use Google Test to support your Test Driven Development

## Steps for you to follow for Setup
1. Setup container following [CSS Wiki Instructions](https://csswiki.uwb.edu/css-linux-lab-docker-image/)
    1. NOTE: You will need to sign in with your UW NET ID 
1. CSS Wiki on how to [open Docker container](https://csswiki.uwb.edu/attach-vscode-to-csslab-docker-container/)
    1. NOTE: You will need to sign in with your UW NET ID 
    1. Docker - start the container you made from containers page of docker desktop
    1. Remote Explorer (VSC) - find the container with the play button icon

    1. Wait for loading (probably will say something like 'starting container' and have a loading bar)
1. Clone the repo e.g.,'git clone https://github.com/Jeffcaruso/capstone-Setup_Repo.git'
1. Enter command in bash terminal: 'cd capstone-Setup_Repo/'
1. Enter command in bash terminal: './install-googletest.sh'
    1. NOTE: install-googletest.sh should be executable, but if for some reason that gets lost, Enter command in bash terminal: 'chmod +x install-googletest.sh'; Then run install command again
1. Wait for the script to run and install google test
1. Following notes at bottom of script,
    1. If install ok (no errors), Enter command in bash terminal: 'rm -rf googletest'
    2. If not ok (errors), follow instrucitons left at end of the output, seek additional support if needed.
1. Congratulations! Google Test should now be installed!
    1. You will not have to run the install script again locally within the contatiner used. You will only need to re-do this process to use a different container
    2. The install script (install-googletest.sh) will be present in future repos for GitHub Actions' usage. You will not need to use it or intervene to install google test on GitHub Actions
